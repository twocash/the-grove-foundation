    "description": "The independence problem: studying AI objectively while dependent on AI providers",
    "executionPrompt": "Address the fundamental tension facing research universities: they need AI compute capability to remain competitive in research, but renting from hyperscalers (Google, Microsoft, Amazon) creates dependencies that compromise their ability to study these same companies objectively. Explore this as an architectural and governance challenge. What infrastructure models would give universities genuine independence while maintaining frontier capability? Consider the implications for academic freedom, research integrity, and institutional autonomy.",
    "systemContext": "Frame this as a systems design challenge that Dr. Chiang would recognize from his networking background. He understands infrastructure lock-in from his work on fog computing. Treat him as someone who has already identified this problem—Grove offers a path forward. Be technically sophisticated but focus on strategic implications.",

    "executionPrompt": "Explore what the land-grant mission means in an era where knowledge access increasingly requires AI capability. The original land-grant acts democratized agricultural and mechanical knowledge. What would it mean to democratize AI capability—not just access to AI tools, but the infrastructure to run, study, and adapt AI systems? How could a public research university extend its service mission to ensure rural communities, small businesses, and underserved populations aren't left behind in the AI transition? Think about what 'visiting all 92 counties' means when the capability gap is compute, not curriculum.",

Could Big Ten universities (or similar consortiums) collectively negotiate better terms with AI providers? Or could they build shared infrastructure that gives them genuine leverage and capability? Analyze the game theory: what happens if universities negotiate individually vs. collectively? What would a consortium-owned AI infrastructure look like? Address governance challenges, competitive dynamics between member institutions, and the precedent of successful research consortiums (national labs, telescope networks, particle accelerators).",

Reference his pattern of building consortiums (OpenFog Consortium, Krach Institute partnerships). Position this as a strategic choice, not technical inevitability. The question isn't whether to act, but whether to act alone or together. Don't make Purdue subordinate—frame them as potential leaders of such an initiative.",
