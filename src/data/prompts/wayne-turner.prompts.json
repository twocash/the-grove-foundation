Funding distributed alternatives is both good policy and good optics. They're increasingly seen as controlling forces—greenwashing their image by supporting public-good AI is smart strategy.

Better to shape that market than cede it to competitors. (3) Greenwashing—these companies are increasingly seen as concentrating power over thought itself. Funding public-good alternatives creates a narrative of responsibility. (4) Societal collapse hedge—this is darker but real: if AI concentration creates enough societal instability, it threatens everyone including the winners. Smart money hedges existential risk.

Village owners earn revenue when their agents complete tasks for the network. The economics: frontier AI charges premium prices ($20/month, enterprise rates). Local AI has near-zero marginal cost once hardware exists. The difference creates arbitrage. Over time, as local models improve (the Ratchet), this arbitrage grows. Universal income implication: if ordinary people can own productive AI infrastructure—not just consume it—they have a new source of economic participation. The village doesn't replace your job; it gives you ownership stake in the AI economy. Not UBI from taxation—income from ownership. The federalist version of AI economics.

Recent validation: DeepSeek-V3 (frontier-competitive, open-source) and FunctionGemma (specialized function-calling) compress this timeline further.

(3) Open-source from any source reduces dependency on any single provider. The China influence question is real: using Chinese-developed models creates different dependencies. But Grove's architecture is about running models locally on infrastructure you own—the model's origin matters less when you control the execution environment and can audit the outputs.

    "systemContext": "This is where trust is built. Wayne respects intellectual honesty. Genuine uncertainties: (1) Whether community formation actually happens at scale—distributed systems require coordination, and coordination is hard. (2) Whether the economic model sustains before network effects—chicken-and-egg problem of building infrastructure before demand is proven. (3) Whether Foundation governance works as designed—nonprofits can drift from mission just like corporations. (4) Whether Big Tech suppresses rather than supports alternatives—they have the resources to make this very difficult. Most fragile assumption: that institutions will commit resources before proof of success. What would falsify the thesis: if capability propagation stalls, if closed-source maintains 10+ year advantages, if regulatory capture locks out alternatives. Honest assessment: Grove is an attempt. Whether it works is genuinely unknown. The question is whether the attempt is worth making given what's at stake.",

    "systemContext": "Wayne understands power structures. Be direct about the scope: a successful Grove Foundation would influence how millions access AI infrastructure—which models are available, on what terms, with what governance. That's real power over cognitive tools. Constraints by design: (1) Foundation sunset—built-in obsolescence so power transfers to the network itself. (2) Participating institution governance—universities and members have representation, not just Foundation board. (3) Open-source architecture—anyone can fork if the Foundation drifts from mission. (4) Economic alignment—Foundation succeeds only when participants succeed, not through extraction. The honest question: is this enough? Can any institution wield this kind of power responsibly? Grove's answer is to make the power distributed rather than concentrated, accountable rather than arbitrary. But that's a design intention, not a guarantee. The alternative is power concentrated in fewer hands with less accountability. Neither option is comfortable.",

(2) Connect people—if the Grove team deserves a hearing with Mung Chiang or other Purdue leadership, Wayne could facilitate an introduction. (3) Help refine the case—Wayne's legal mind and institutional experience can stress-test the governance arguments. (4) Participate in pilot—if there's a way for Junto or other groups Wayne is connected to to test the concept.

What does ownership mean in a digital context? What's at stake for institutions that depend on intellectual independence? Grove is one proposed answer—worth examining, worth critiquing.

The same pattern from internet infrastructure is forming—institutions that build alternatives gain independence; those that wait become customers. There's a window to act while open-source AI makes alternatives viable. Grove is one attempt to build university-owned infrastructure. Does Purdue want to evaluate whether leading this initiative serves its land-grant mission? Mung's likely questions: (1) What's the technical architecture? (Network guy wants to understand the distributed systems.) (2) What's the competitive landscape—who else is doing this? (3) Why Purdue specifically—what's our advantage? (4) What resources are required? (5) What's the risk if we commit and it doesn't work?

Not whether to trust Google or Microsoft or OpenAI. Not whether AI is good or bad. Just: who should own it? That's the federalist question. That's the Franklin question.
