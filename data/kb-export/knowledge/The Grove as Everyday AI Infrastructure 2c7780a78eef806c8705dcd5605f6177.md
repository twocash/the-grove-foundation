The **Grove is how you access your own AI, and the “civilization” is what makes it better than alternatives.**

The Terminal isn't a novelty interface for simulation-watchers. It's the primary way millions of people will interact with AI — except they own the infrastructure, the agents know them, and the collective intelligence of the network improves every with response and every cloud call.

## Three-Tier Terminal Model

### Tier 1: Everyday Requests (Local-First)

Standard LLM tasks routed to your village's capable agents:

- "Summarize this article"
- "Draft a reply to this email"
- "Explain this concept to me"
- "Help me brainstorm names for X"

**Compute:** Primarily local. Minimal or zero credits. This is the "free tier" behavior that makes Grove sticky.

**Differentiation from ChatGPT:** Your agents *remember*. They know your writing style, your preferences, your ongoing projects. The civilization IS the personalization layer. No starting from scratch every session.

### Tier 2: Project Work (Hybrid)

Multi-step tasks requiring coordination and time:

- "Research competitive landscape for X and compile findings"
- "Monitor these sources for developments on Y"
- "Review this document and flag inconsistencies"

**Compute:** Local coordination + selective cloud enlightenment. Moderate credit spend. Hours to days of agent effort.

**Differentiation:** You're not prompting a model - you're delegating to a team. The diary system shows you *how* they approached the work. You see Marcus consulting the knowledge commons, Elena synthesizing sources, disagreement and resolution. The process is transparent.

### Tier 3: Sophisticated Service (Cloud-Heavy)

Complex, ongoing work that justifies premium economics:

- "Maintain this codebase — fix bugs, refactor, document"
- "Manage my research bibliography and surface relevant new papers"
- "Run ongoing analysis of my portfolio against market conditions"

**Compute:** Heavy cloud enlightenment for pivotal decisions. Significant credit spend. Weeks to months of sustained effort.

**Differentiation:** This is the sci-fi vision, but the architecture supports it. You're not buying a SaaS product - you're cultivating a capability. The agents get better at your specific problem domain through accumulated experience.

## The Practical Vision: Development Guidance

### What this means for MVP:

Terminal v1 must feel immediately useful. Day one, a user should be able to:

1. Type a request
2. Get a competent response
3. See which agent(s) handled it
4. Notice that the agent remembers context from yesterday

The civilization layer isn't a separate "watch the simulation" mode — it's visible in every interaction. "Elena handled your request. She consulted her notes from your last conversation and cross-referenced the village knowledge base."

### What this means for the UI:

Two modes, one interface:

**Active Mode:** The Terminal. Request-response. Feels like a chat interface but with agent attribution and process visibility.

**Passive Mode:** The Diaries. Catch up on what your village did while you were away. This is the "social media feed" that drives return visits - but it's showing you work done, not just social drama.

**The insight:** You're not choosing between utility and entertainment. The utility generates the entertainment. Your village working on your research project IS the compelling content.

## The Competitive Positioning

### vs. ChatGPT/Claude:

- They're tools. Grove is staff.
- They forget. Grove remembers.
- They're rented. Grove is owned.
- They're isolated. Grove is networked.

### vs. Personal AI assistants (Rabbit, Humane):

- They're trying to replace the phone. Grove runs on equipment you already own.
- They're cloud-dependent. Grove's cloud dependency shrinks.
- They're corporate infrastructure. Grove is collectively owned.

### The honest trade-off:

- Day one, ChatGPT is more capable on complex reasoning.
- Day one, Grove is more persistent, more personal, more yours.
- The Ratchet closes the capability gap. The architecture advantages are permanent.

## The "Knowledge Commons" Dividend

This is underdeveloped in current docs but crucial to the everyday AI story:

When you ask your village a question, you're not just getting your agents' intelligence. You're getting:

1. Your agents' accumulated knowledge about you
2. Your village's learned approaches to similar problems
3. The knowledge commons — what thousands of other villages discovered

**Example:** You ask "Help me write a grant proposal." Your village has never written a grant proposal. But the commons has 47 villages that have, and their successful approaches (anonymized, attributed) inform your agents' response.

**This is the moat.** ChatGPT has training data. Grove has accumulated, living knowledge from real usage, continuously updated, collectively owned.

## The Economic Story for Users

**Free tier:** Everyday requests. Local compute. No credits required.

- This is how you acquire users. Grove competes with free ChatGPT tier on ownership and persistence, not raw capability.

**Credit tier:** Project and sophisticated work. Cloud enlightenment.

- Users buy credits when they want more than local capability can provide.
- Credits fund infrastructure. Your purchase improves the network.

**Contributor tier:** Worldsmiths who add capability earn credits.

- Knowledge contributions to commons
- Specialized agent training
- Infrastructure operation (relay nodes, etc.)
