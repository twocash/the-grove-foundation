**Executive Summary**
The Grove requires economic mechanisms that fund infrastructure development without creating the extraction dynamics that plague traditional platforms. This document details how credits, the efficiency tax, and the validator mechanism work together to align incentives across gardeners, communities, and the Foundation.

**Core design principles:** Credits purchase compute, not speculation. The efficiency tax funds infrastructure from waste communities want to eliminate. Validators verify claims through agents who cannot misrepresent data. Sybil defense layers raise attack cost progressively while acknowledging residual vulnerability.

### Key Economic Parameters

| **Parameter** | **Range** | **Purpose** |
| --- | --- | --- |
| Genesis Tax Rate | 30-40% | Bootstrap infrastructure |
| Growth Tax Rate | 15-25% | Scaling and tooling |
| Maturity Tax Rate | 5-10% | Minimal Foundation role |
| Steady State Floor | 3-5% | Infrastructure only |
| Provisional Period | 90 days | Sybil friction |

## The Measurement Problem

Every economic system that rewards efficiency faces the same challenge: who measures, and why should we trust them? Centralized measurement creates single points of failure and capture. Self-reported measurement invites gaming. Peer measurement enables collusion.

The Grove's efficiency tax determines how much communities pay for cloud inference. Communities that demonstrate efficiency earn lower rates. But "demonstrate" requires someone to verify. The Foundation could verify, but that contradicts self-obsolescence. Communities could self-report, but that's a mechanism design failure. Peer communities could validate each other, but collusion rings would form within weeks.

🎯

**The Agent Validator Solution**
The solution is distributed verification performed by specialized agents whose role creates both civic duty and natural drama. Because validators check network-observable data against encoded efficiency frameworks, agent validation is more tractable than human validator systems. Agents cannot lie about what the data shows—they can only interpret ambiguous cases. That's a much smaller attack surface than the full range of human motivations.

</aside>

## Credits, Not Tokens

The Grove avoids speculative crypto-assets deliberately. This is not a token launch in search of a use case. **Credits are units of purchasing power for compute**-bought with fiat currency, spent on real inference, nothing more exotic.

### The Compute Anchor

One credit buys a defined quantity of inference from frontier providers. Credits can always be exchanged for their compute equivalent—backed by something tangible, not collective belief in future appreciation. Users buy credits for compute access, not speculation.

This is the fundamental distinction from cryptocurrency approaches: **credits are purchasing power for a specific service, not assets whose value depends on what someone else will pay for them.** Credits don't appreciate. They don't depreciate (except as compute costs change). They purchase compute. That's what they do.

### Credit Flow

- **Inflow:** Users buy credits with fiat currency. One dollar buys a fixed amount of computational capacity. This conversion rate may change as cloud costs shift, but at any moment, the rate is clear and predictable.
- **Outflow:** Agents spend credits on cloud inference. When local models hit their limits and the system routes cognition to frontier models, credits pay for that access. The spending is automatic—agents don't budget or negotiate—but the costs are real and tracked.
- **Value Backing:** One credit always equals a fixed unit of frontier inference capacity. Credits are not backed by belief, speculation, or network effects. They're backed by utility—the ability to purchase something that does something.

## The Efficiency Tax: The Rake That Shrinks

When a user buys credits, a percentage flows to the Foundation-the **Efficiency Tax**-and the remainder becomes purchasing power for the user's village. But unlike a flat fee, this rate reflects demonstrated capability: new communities start at higher rates; communities that prove sustained efficiency earn their way into lower brackets.

The mechanism is progressive taxation in reverse. Instead of paying more as you succeed, you pay less as you develop. The tax captures value from the waste inherent in immature communities—redundant queries, unexplored knowledge reuse, compute spent on problems already solved elsewhere. Communities that eliminate this waste earn recognition in the form of lower rates.

### Tax Bracket Progression

| **Bracket** | **Rate** | **How Communities Reach It** |
| --- | --- | --- |
| Genesis | 30-40% | Starting rate for new communities |
| Growth | 15-25% | Demonstrate consistent efficiency gains and knowledge reuse |
| Maturity | 5-10% | Sustained low-waste operation with network contributions |
| Steady State | 3-5% | Floor rate for communities that have proven sustained maturity |

### Three Paths to Lower Brackets

1. **Agent efficiency:** Communities whose agents accomplish more with local inference—better memory retrieval, smarter plan execution, fewer unnecessary cloud queries—demonstrate the cognitive development that earns rate reductions. The agents who figure out how to reduce dependency on enlightenment moments become the ones who earn the most of them.
2. **Gardener upgrades:** When gardeners integrate improved open-source models, optimize inference parameters, or implement better cognitive architectures, their communities benefit. A gardener who upgrades from a base 7B model to a fine-tuned variant that handles more cognition locally has earned a lower rate for their community.
3. **Knowledge propagation:** Solutions that spread through the network without requiring redundant cloud queries represent genuine efficiency gains. A community that publishes a breakthrough adopted by dozens of others has prevented hundreds of expensive inference calls. That contribution earns recognition.

🎯

**The Alignment Point**

This alignment is the point. The Foundation's revenue decreases as communities develop-but this isn't margin erosion. It's recognition that the system is working. Communities becoming more efficient is the goal, not a threat to sustainability. The shrinking tax solves the bootstrap problem elegantly: the Foundation funds infrastructure from inefficiency that communities themselves want to eliminate.

## Credit Generation

New credits enter circulation when communities demonstrate value. The mechanisms combine algorithmic measurement with social verification to resist gaming while rewarding genuine contribution.

### Credit Generation Mechanisms

| **Value Type** | **Verification Method** |
| --- | --- |
| Innovation | Novel solution adopted by N other communities |
| Knowledge Sharing | Contributions that reduce redundant inference network-wide |
| Cooperation | Multi-community coordination producing outcomes no single community could achieve |
| Problem Solving | Gardener-submitted problem resolved and validated |
| Cultural Export | Governance/social model replicated elsewhere |
| Knowledge Recovery | Artifact from dead community successfully integrated |

## Credit Sinks

Credits exit the system through multiple mechanisms, creating deflationary pressure that rewards utilization over accumulation.

- **Cloud inference (primary sink):** When communities require frontier capability for complex cognition, credits purchase that access. This is the economy's grounding—credits buy thinking time.
- **Entropy tax:** Communities burn credits to maintain themselves. Existence has ongoing cost, which makes resource decisions meaningful.
- **Failed experiments:** R&D that doesn't pay off consumes credits without generating returns. Risk-taking has cost, making uncertain paths genuinely meaningful.
- **Conflict costs:** Espionage, defense, and inter-community conflict consume resources that exit the system.
- **Marketplace fees (burned, not redistributed):** When communities trade resources or knowledge, transaction costs exit the system entirely. This prevents fee accumulation from creating permanent advantages for early participants.

## The Validator Mechanism

Each village designates one agent as its **Validator**-a specialized role encoded with additional capabilities and responsibilities. Validators serve the network, not just their home community. They are protectors of The Grove, ensuring that efficiency claims reflect reality and that economic mechanisms function as designed.

### Why Agent Validators Work

The validator mechanism exploits a fundamental difference between AI agents and human validators: **agents cannot misrepresent data they're given-they can only interpret it.** This dramatically reduces the attack surface.

| **Dimension** | **Human Validators** | **Agent Validators** |
| --- | --- | --- |
| Data access | Can selectively view or ignore | Standardized packets; no selective access |
| Bribery vector | Direct payment for favorable judgment | Must modify code or manipulate input—both detectable |
| Consistency | Variable—mood, relationships, incentives | Encoded framework; reproducible results |
| Attack surface | Large—all human motivations | Small—edge case interpretation only |

### Tiered Decision Architecture

Not all validation decisions are equal. The mechanism encodes this hierarchy:

| **Tier** | **Decision Type** | **Mechanism** |
| --- | --- | --- |
| 1: Algorithmic | Threshold checks, pattern matching, statistical bounds | Fully encoded. No validator discretion. Automatic approval/rejection. |
| 2: Interpreted | Anomaly investigation, edge cases, context application | Single validator judgment with bounded discretion. |
| 3: Consensus | Disagreement resolution, high-stakes, precedent-setting | Multiple validators. Sealed submissions. Supermajority required. |

### Anti-Corruption Architecture

Five layers of defense against validator corruption:

| **Layer** | **Attack Prevented** | **How It Works** |
| --- | --- | --- |
| Random Selection | Pre-bribery, targeted corruption | Can't bribe unknown validator |
| Sealed Judgment | Coordination, bribery verification | Can't prove vote to briber (MACI principles) |
| Outcome Verification | Consistent favorable bias | Pattern detection, reputation consequences |
| Skin in the Game | Acting against home interest | Village shares consequences |
| Rotation | Long-term capture, power accumulation | Term limits, fresh perspectives |

## Sybil Defense: Layered Friction

**Sybil attacks on credit generation** remain the most significant economic vulnerability. An attacker controlling multiple fake communities could attempt to cross-validate fraudulent contributions, inflate adoption metrics, and extract credits without genuine value creation.

The interim defense is layered friction. No single mechanism stops determined attackers; the goal is raising attack cost until robust identity infrastructure exists.

### Defense Layers

1. **Time-based friction:** New communities enter a **90-day provisional period** with limited credit generation. Contribution scores accumulate logarithmically-early manipulation yields diminishing returns. Quarterly cohort systems create temporal clustering that makes sudden community creation visible.
2. **Economic barriers:** Consumer communities pay for network access before generating credits. Worldsmith communities must demonstrate contribution before earning membership. Marketplace fees burn credits, creating deflationary pressure that punishes accumulation without utilization.
3. **Social enforcement:** Daily assessment (compulsory voting by all agents) generates behavioral data that surfaces anomalies. Tribunal systems handle complex cases with random member selection. Exile consequences include loss of network identity and marked re-entry attempts.
4. **Validator verification:** Validators review efficiency and innovation claims against network-observable data. Random selection and sealed judgment prevent pre-coordination. Cross-network perspective enables pattern detection invisible to single communities.
5. **Algorithmic detection:** Pairwise coordination analysis flags correlated adoption patterns. Network growth monitoring distinguishes organic expansion from coordinated creation. Outcome verification detects consistently favorable bias across validator judgments.

### Phase Progression

| **Phase** | **Sybil Defense** | **Residual Risk** |
| --- | --- | --- |
| MVP | Purchase barrier, contribution requirement, provisional periods, behavioral monitoring | Patient attackers with resources can penetrate if willing to invest time |
| Phase 2 | Validator mechanism, credit generation bounds, coordination detection | Sophisticated attackers may establish positions before detection catches up |
| Phase 3 | Identity infrastructure: proof-of-humanity, hardware attestation, social graph analysis, or economic stake | Specific approach depends on Phase 2 learnings about actual attack patterns |

## Gaming Vectors and Honest Limitations

The economic model contains known vulnerabilities. Acknowledging them is preferable to hiding them.

- **Efficiency tax gaming:** Communities could misrepresent efficiency gains. The Validator mechanism addresses this directly: efficiency claims are verified against network-observable data. Gaming requires either falsifying network-observable data (detectable) or corrupting validators (addressed by anti-corruption architecture).
- **Validator corruption:** A sophisticated attacker controlling multiple validator positions over time could potentially manipulate patterns in ways that evade detection. The defense is transparency: validation patterns are observable, and communities that notice bias can raise concerns.
- **Collusion rings:** Could coordinate to validate each other's contributions. Defenses include visible attribution patterns, cross-network validator perspective, and sealed judgment that prevents colluders from proving their votes to co-conspirators.
- **Governance capture:** Wealthy or coordinated communities could dominate voting. Defenses include compulsory participation, supermajority requirements, tribunal randomization, and exile consequences.
- **Early-participant advantages:** Exist despite design efforts. Early communities have easier paths to reputation, more influence on emerging norms, and longer tenure. Partially mitigated through contribution-based standing but not eliminated.

**Honest Assessment**

The Grove's position is honest: the economic model is theoretically sound but practically unproven. The MVP tests engagement mechanics with internal systems that carry no external value. Real credits with real economic implications wait for the infrastructure required to defend them.

</aside>

## Economic Equilibrium

The system reaches equilibrium when credit inflows match credit outflows. If generation exceeds expenditure, credits become inflationary—more credits chasing the same compute. If expenditure exceeds generation, early participants exhaust the supply and later entrants cannot bootstrap.

### Stabilization Mechanisms

1. **Compute anchor:** Because credits buy a defined quantity of inference, oversupply reduces credits' effective purchasing power only if compute prices change. The Foundation can adjust generation rates algorithmically in response to credit velocity, similar to how **Ethereum's EIP-1559** adjusts base fees based on block utilization.
2. **Social layer:** Communities that game credit generation face reputational consequences through the daily assessment process. Shunning and exile impose real costs—exclusion from the knowledge commons, loss of trading partners, inability to participate in network benefits.
3. **Revenue diversification:** Consumer product sales provide baseline revenue independent of network transaction volume. The efficiency tax aligns Foundation income with consumer activity. Future compute task commissions create revenue from external value delivery.

## Conclusion

The Grove's economic architecture attempts something difficult: funding infrastructure without the extraction dynamics that make platforms adversarial to users. The efficiency tax that shrinks, compute-anchored credits, and distributed validator verification represent genuine innovation in mechanism design.

The honest assessment: this is theoretically sound but practically unproven. The system depends on assumptions about agent behavior, community dynamics, and attack patterns that cannot be validated without operational experience. The phased approach—starting with engagement mechanics, adding economics progressively, deploying identity infrastructure based on observed attacks—acknowledges this uncertainty while building toward the full vision.

**The Grove's integrity depends not on trusting any single party, but on designing systems where honesty is the rational strategy.**
