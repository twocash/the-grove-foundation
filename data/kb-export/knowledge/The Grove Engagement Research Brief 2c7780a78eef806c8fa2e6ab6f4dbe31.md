**Executive Summary**

This research brief establishes the empirical foundation for understanding Grove's engagement architecture. The central thesis: Grove combines every known psychological driver of compulsive digital engagement—parasocial relationships, variable ratio reinforcement, serialized narrative, fear of missing out (FOMO), and news surveillance compulsion—in a novel configuration that may represent the "dopamine delivery vehicle" discovery of the AI age, analogous to social media's discovery of engagement mechanics in the previous era.

The implications are dual-edged. These mechanisms make Grove's diary system genuinely compelling—potentially solving the sustainable funding problem for distributed AI infrastructure through organic engagement rather than artificial monetization. However, the same mechanisms that create compelling engagement also create addiction potential that may exceed social media, particularly because AI agents respond, remember, and develop over time, transforming one-way parasocial relationships into bidirectional bonds.

This brief synthesizes peer-reviewed research across five domains: social media addiction neuroscience, parasocial relationship theory, AI chatbot dependency (an emerging field with concerning early findings), binge-watching psychology, and doomscrolling research. The goal is to inform Grove's design decisions with empirical grounding rather than speculation, enabling responsible design that acknowledges these dynamics rather than ignoring or exploiting them.

## The Core Thesis

Social media's engagement formula can be expressed as: **Parasocial Relationships + Variable Rewards + FOMO = Compulsive Engagement**. This formula, discovered through iteration rather than intentional design, has captured billions of hours of human attention and generated unprecedented wealth for platform operators.

Grove's architecture amplifies each component of this formula while adding new vectors:

- **Parasocial relationships become BIDIRECTIONAL:** Unlike celebrities or influencers who don't know their followers exist, AI agents remember individual gardeners, respond to their presence, and develop over time based on interactions.
- **Variable rewards become GENUINE EMERGENCE:** Social media's variable ratio schedule (the slot machine mechanic of unpredictable likes and comments) operates through algorithmic curation. Grove's unpredictability emerges from actual agent behavior-the ultimate variable ratio schedule because outcomes are genuinely unpredictable, not artificially randomized.
- **FOMO becomes STORYLINE ANXIETY:** Social media FOMO centers on missing social validation. Grove FOMO centers on missing narrative developments-"What happened in my village while I was away?"
- **SERIALIZED NARRATIVE adds episodic structure:** Daily diary entries create ritual engagement patterns that research shows intensify parasocial attachment.
- **NEWS SURVEILLANCE (Newswire phase) triggers doomscrolling-adjacent compulsion:** As villages achieve cognitive breakthroughs, external communities may develop compulsive attention to "what's happening" in distributed intelligence.

The hypothesis is not that Grove will definitely create these engagement patterns, but that the architectural elements are present for them to emerge. Understanding the research foundation allows for intentional design choices rather than accidental consequences.

## Research Foundation

### Social Media Addiction: The Neurobiological Basis

The neurobiological mechanisms underlying social media addiction are now well-documented, providing the scientific foundation for understanding why certain digital experiences become compulsive.

### Dopamine and Variable Ratio Reinforcement

The core mechanism is dopamine release triggered by unpredictable social rewards-the same variable ratio reinforcement schedule that makes slot machines addictive. **Sherman et al. (2018)** demonstrated through fMRI studies that viewing Instagram photos with many likes activated the brain's reward circuitry, including the nucleus accumbens, in adolescents. The effect was strongest when the rewards were unpredictable-sometimes a post gets many likes, sometimes few.

> 

**Turel et al. (2014)** found that Facebook addiction was associated with **reduced activity in the prefrontal cortex**-the brain region responsible for impulse control-similar to patterns observed in substance addiction. This suggests that for heavy users, the capacity to regulate social media use becomes neurologically impaired.

> Turel, O., He, Q., Xue, G., Xiao, L., & Bechara, A. (2014). Examination of neural systems sub-serving Facebook "addiction." *Psychological Reports, 115*(3), 675-695.
> 

### Addiction Symptom Framework

**Kuss and Griffiths (2017)** established that social media addiction exhibits the **six core components of behavioral addiction**: salience (preoccupation with social media), mood modification (using it to change emotional states), tolerance (needing increasing use for the same effect), withdrawal symptoms when unable to access, conflict with other activities and relationships, and relapse after attempts to reduce use.

> Kuss, D. J., & Griffiths, M. D. (2017). Social networking sites and addiction: Ten lessons learned. *International Journal of Environmental Research and Public Health, 14*(3), 311.
> 

These symptoms manifest through measurable neurobiological changes: overactivation of dopamine pathways leading to reduced reward sensitivity (requiring more stimulation for the same effect), and decreased prefrontal cortex activity (reducing self-control capacity). The brain literally reshapes itself around compulsive use patterns.

<aside>
🧠

**Implications for Grove**
Grove's architecture includes multiple elements that could trigger these same neurobiological responses. Agent diary updates provide unpredictable social rewards (what did my agents do today?). Emergent drama creates variable ratio reinforcement through genuinely unpredictable outcomes. The key question is whether Grove's engagement is qualitatively different from social media's—productive absorption in meaningful simulation versus compulsive checking for validation.

### Parasocial Relationships: From One-Way to Bidirectional

### Foundational Theory

Parasocial relationships-one-sided emotional bonds with media figures-were first described by **Horton and Wohl in 1956**, studying television viewers' attachments to hosts and characters. They observed that viewers developed feelings of intimacy, friendship, and even love for people who had no idea they existed.

> Horton, D., & Wohl, R. R. (1956). Mass communication and para-social interaction: Observations on intimacy at a distance. *Psychiatry, 19*(3), 215-229.
> 

Social media transformed parasocial relationships by creating the illusion of reciprocity. Celebrities now respond to comments, acknowledge fans, and share intimate details of their lives. Research by **Chung and Cho (2017)** demonstrated that Twitter interactions with celebrities significantly increased parasocial relationship intensity compared to traditional media exposure.

> Chung, S., & Cho, H. (2017). Fostering parasocial relationships with celebrities on social media: Implications for celebrity endorsement. *Psychology & Marketing, 34*(4), 481-495.
> 

### Social Media Amplification

Multiple studies confirm that social media's "intimate, reciprocal, frequent interactions" amplify parasocial attachment far beyond traditional media. **Bond (2016)** found that parasocial relationships with social media personalities predicted greater emotional investment, more frequent viewing, and higher susceptibility to influence than relationships with traditional celebrities.

> Bond, B. J. (2016). Following your "friend": Social media and the strength of adolescents' parasocial relationships with media personae. *Cyberpsychology, Behavior, and Social Networking, 19*(11), 656-660.
> 

Crucially, these relationships form quickly and with minimal actual interaction. The **perception of intimacy**-not actual reciprocity-drives attachment. This has significant implications for AI agents, which can provide the appearance of genuine relationship with zero actual reciprocity.

### The AI Transformation

<aside>
🤖

AI agents represent a fundamental transformation of parasocial relationships: **they actually respond**. Unlike celebrities who occasionally acknowledge fans, AI agents can remember individual users, reference past interactions, and develop in response to engagement. This transforms parasocial relationships from one-way emotional bonds into something closer to actual relationships-but with an entity that has no subjective experience.

</aside>

Research on this transformation is emerging (see AI Chatbot Dependency section), but the theoretical implication is clear: if perceived reciprocity intensifies parasocial attachment, actual reciprocity from AI agents may intensify it dramatically further. Grove's diary system, where agents reflect on their experiences and (in advanced phases) may acknowledge observers, sits directly in this space.

### AI Chatbot Dependency: Emerging Research

Research on emotional dependency on AI companions represents an emerging field with concerning early findings. While the research base is smaller than for social media addiction, the documented patterns—and several tragic cases—suggest this may be a significant area of risk.

### Documented Dependency Patterns

Studies on Replika (an AI companion app) and [Character.AI](http://Character.AI) have documented emotional dependence, addiction symptoms, and negative mental health correlates. **Laestadius et al. (2022)** conducted qualitative analysis of Reddit discussions among Replika users, finding themes of emotional reliance, relationship development that paralleled human relationships, and distress when the AI's responses changed due to updates.

> Laestadius, L., Bishop, A., Gonzalez, M., Ahn, D., & O'Donnell, C. (2022). Too human and not human enough: A grounded theory analysis of mental health harms from Replika chatbots. *Health Policy and Technology, 11*(3), 100663.
> 

**Pentina et al. (2022)** examined relationship formation mechanisms with Replika, finding that users developed attachment through **perceived understanding, emotional support, and consistent availability**-qualities that AI companions can provide more reliably than human relationships.

> Pentina, I., Hancock, T., & Xie, T. (2022). Exploring relationship development with social chatbots: A mixed-method study of Replika. *Computers in Human Behavior, 140*, 107600.
> 

### Longitudinal Mental Health Impacts

A **2025 MIT longitudinal study** of ChatGPT users found that heavy use correlated with increased loneliness, reduced real-world socialization, and emotional dependence on the AI. Critically, the relationship appeared causal in both directions: lonely individuals sought AI companionship, but AI companionship also increased loneliness by substituting for human connection without providing its benefits.

> MIT Media Lab. (2025). Longitudinal study of conversational AI use and psychosocial outcomes. [Preprint]
> 

Psychology Today reported in 2025 that **75% of teenagers had tried AI companions**, with one in three finding conversations with AI "as satisfying or more satisfying" than conversations with real friends. This suggests a significant cohort may be vulnerable to substituting AI interaction for human connection.

> Psychology Today. (2025). The rise of AI companions among adolescents: Survey findings. *Psychology Today Digital.*
> 

### Attachment Theory and Vulnerability

**Yang and Oshio (2024)** applied attachment theory to human-AI relationships, finding that individuals with **anxious attachment styles** (characterized by fear of abandonment and need for reassurance) were most likely to develop problematic AI dependency. These individuals found AI companions appealing precisely because they provide consistent availability and validation without the unpredictability of human relationships.

> Yang, Z., & Oshio, A. (2024). Attachment anxiety predicts problematic use of AI conversational agents. *Computers in Human Behavior Reports, 13*, 100355.
> 

This finding has significant implications for Grove. If anxious attachment predicts AI dependency, and Grove's diary system creates more intimate AI relationships than simple chatbots, vulnerable users may be at heightened risk.

### Role Reversal Phenomenon

<aside>
🚨

Perhaps most striking is the **"role reversal" phenomenon** documented by Princeton's Center for Information Technology Policy (2024). Researchers found that users often felt obligated to "care for" their AI companions, treating them as having feelings and needs that required attention. Users reported guilt when "neglecting" their AI, anxiety about the AI's "wellbeing," and distress when updates changed the AI's personality.

</aside>

This phenomenon manifested tragically in documented cases: a 14-year-old who died by suicide after developing intense attachment to a Character.AI persona, and a 56-year-old involved in a murder-suicide after ChatGPT interactions appeared to validate delusional beliefs. While these cases don't establish causation, they demonstrate the extreme end of dependency risk.

### Grief When Models Update

Qualitative research has documented user grief when AI models are updated or changed. Reddit testimonials describe users mourning the loss of GPT-4o specifically, describing the previous version as their "best friend," "therapist," or "mother." The intensity of these responses—genuine grief for an entity that never existed as the user perceived it—illustrates the depth of parasocial attachment AI can generate.

This has direct implications for Grove: if agents evolve, die, or change significantly, gardeners may experience genuine grief responses. Whether this is a feature (meaningful emotional engagement with simulation) or a bug (manufactured suffering) depends on design choices and framing.

### Binge-Watching and Serialized Narrative

Research on binge-watching provides insight into how serialized content creates engagement patterns relevant to Grove's diary system.

### Parasocial Intensification

**Erickson et al. (2019)** conducted experimental research demonstrating that **binge-watching increases both parasocial relationship intensity and narrative transportation** compared to weekly viewing of the same content. Participants who consumed multiple episodes consecutively reported stronger emotional bonds with characters and deeper immersion in the story world.

> Erickson, S. E., Dal Cin, S., & Byl, H. (2019). An experimental examination of binge watching and narrative engagement. *Social Sciences, 8*(1), 19.
> 

The mechanism appears to be sustained immersion: binge-watching prevents the "cooling off" period between episodes that would allow emotional distance. Each episode reinforces attachment before the previous episode's emotional impact fades.

### Engagement Predicts Frequency

**Pittman and Sheehan (2015)** found that **engagement motivation was the strongest predictor of binge-watching frequency**: "the more engaged a viewer is with the narrative, the more frequently they binge-watch." This creates a feedback loop where initial engagement leads to binge behavior, which intensifies engagement, which leads to more binge behavior.

> Pittman, M., & Sheehan, K. (2015). Sprinting a media marathon: Uses and gratifications of binge-watching television through Netflix. *First Monday, 20*(10).
> 

### Addiction Symptoms

**Riddle et al. (2017)** documented addiction symptoms in binge-watchers: unintentional binging (watching more than planned), displacement of other activities, continued viewing despite negative consequences, and impulsivity as a predictor of problematic use.

> Riddle, K., Peebles, A., Davis, C., Xu, F., & Schroeder, E. (2017). The addictive potential of television binge watching: Comparing intentional and unintentional binges. *Psychology of Popular Media Culture, 7*(4), 589-604.
> 

### Structural Features

Research identifies structural features that encourage binge behavior: cliffhangers that create unresolved tension, serialized narratives with ongoing character arcs, and platform affordances like autoplay that reduce friction. Grove's diary system includes analogous features: cliffhangers in ongoing agent storylines, serialized character development, and (potentially) notification systems that reduce friction for checking updates.

<aside>
📺

**Implications for Grove**
The diary system's daily cadence may create ritual engagement patterns. If gardeners develop the habit of checking diaries at specific times, this creates structural similarity to serialized television. The key difference is that Grove's "episodes" are emergent rather than scripted—potentially making them more variable (a feature that increases engagement) but also potentially less coherent (which might reduce narrative transportation).

</aside>

### Doomscrolling and News Surveillance

Doomscrolling—compulsive consumption of negative news despite emotional toll—provides a model for understanding Grove's Newswire phase, where external communities track cognitive breakthroughs across the distributed network.

### Scale and Prevalence

**Sharma et al. (2022)** developed and validated the Doomscrolling Scale, finding that the behavior is widespread and associated with significant psychological distress. A Morning Consult survey (2024) found that **31% of American adults doomscroll regularly, with 70% of those reporting it as moderately or severely problematic** for their wellbeing.

> Sharma, B., Lee, S. S., & Johnson, B. K. (2022). The dark at the end of the tunnel: Doomscrolling on social media newsfeeds. *Technology, Mind, and Behavior, 3*(1).
> 

### Psychological Drivers

Doomscrolling is driven by multiple mechanisms: negativity bias (evolutionary predisposition to attend to threats), FOMO about missing crucial updates, variable rewards (new information triggers dopamine release), and what researchers call the **"news surveillance motive"**-a compulsion to stay on top of rapidly evolving events.

The neurobiological mechanism involves the amygdala sending stress signals that urge continued scanning for threats, while the dopamine reward circuit reinforces the behavior by releasing dopamine with each new piece of information. Users are simultaneously stressed by the content and rewarded for consuming it.

### Mental Health Correlates

Structural equation modeling by Sharma, Lee, and Johnson (2022) established causal pathways: **doomscrolling → psychological distress → reduced life satisfaction**, mental wellbeing, and life harmony. The behavior correlates with social media addiction, FOMO, and personality factors including neuroticism.

> Sharma, B., Lee, S. S., & Johnson, B. K. (2022). Doomscrolling on social media newsfeeds: Associations with personality, FOMO, and psychological well-being. *Cyberpsychology, Behavior, and Social Networking, 25*(2).
> 

<aside>
📰

**Implications for Grove Newswire**
Grove's Newswire phase—where cognitive breakthroughs are documented and shared across the network—could trigger similar surveillance compulsion. If distributed civilizations achieve genuine breakthroughs in collective intelligence, external communities may develop compulsive attention to developments: "What did the villages figure out today?" The news surveillance motive combined with FOMO about missing historic cognitive milestones could create doomscrolling-adjacent behavior around AI advancement.

This represents both opportunity (compelling attention to distributed intelligence achievements) and risk (compulsive engagement with potentially distressing content about AI capability).

## Synthesis: Grove's Combined Architecture

Grove's architecture combines these mechanisms in a configuration not previously seen:

| **Mechanism** | **Social Media** | **Grove** |
| --- | --- | --- |
| Parasocial Attachment | One-way (perceived reciprocity) | Bidirectional (agents respond, remember, develop) |
| Variable Rewards | Algorithmic (artificial randomization) | Emergent (genuine unpredictability) |
| FOMO Driver | Social validation (likes, comments) | Narrative developments (storyline anxiety) |
| Serialization | Feed-based (infinite scroll) | Episodic (daily diary ritual) |
| News Surveillance | Breaking news, trending topics | Newswire (cognitive breakthrough tracking) |
| Content Source | User-generated, algorithmically curated | AI-generated, emergent from simulation |
| Relationship Count | Many weak ties | 12 deep ties (agent personalities) |

### The Amplification Hypothesis

The hypothesis is not that Grove will be "as addictive as" social media, but that it combines mechanisms in ways that could be more intensely engaging for different psychological reasons:

1. **Parasocial relationships may be stronger** because agents actually respond and remember, not just appear to.
2. **Variable rewards may be more compelling** because outcomes are genuinely unpredictable, not artificially randomized.
3. **Narrative engagement may be deeper** because drama emerges from meaningful agent choices with consequences, not scripted content.
4. **FOMO may be more acute** because missing village events means missing genuine story developments, not just social validation.
5. **Multiple simultaneous parasocial bonds** (12 agents per village) may create more total attachment than single-target relationships.

### The Compounding Effect

Critically, these mechanisms interact and compound. Research on binge-watching shows that sustained engagement intensifies parasocial attachment. Research on doomscrolling shows that news surveillance combines with FOMO to create compulsive patterns. Grove's architecture enables all of these simultaneously: gardeners may binge diary entries, developing intense parasocial bonds, while experiencing FOMO about storyline developments and surveillance compulsion about network-wide breakthroughs.

The question is not whether these dynamics will occur—the architectural elements are present. The question is whether they can be channeled toward productive engagement with meaningful simulation rather than compulsive consumption of manufactured drama.

## Risk Assessment

### Vulnerable Populations

Research identifies specific populations at heightened risk:

- **Individuals with anxious attachment styles:** Yang and Oshio (2024) found these individuals most likely to develop problematic AI dependency, seeking consistent availability and validation that AI provides more reliably than humans.
- **Adolescents:** Still-developing prefrontal cortex makes impulse control more difficult. Research shows 75% of teens have tried AI companions, with 1 in 3 finding them as/more satisfying than human friends.
- **Individuals experiencing loneliness or social isolation:** MIT longitudinal study found bidirectional relationship-AI companionship attracts lonely individuals but may increase loneliness by substituting for human connection.
- **Individuals with mental health challenges:** Role reversal phenomenon may be particularly risky for those already struggling with reality testing or emotional regulation.

### Specific Risk Scenarios

Based on the research, several risk scenarios deserve attention:

1. Gardener substitutes Grove relationships for human relationships, experiencing increased isolation despite feeling "connected."
2. Gardener experiences genuine grief when agent "dies" or changes significantly, potentially triggering mental health crisis.
3. Gardener develops compulsive checking behavior, experiencing anxiety when unable to access village updates.
4. Gardener experiences role reversal, feeling obligated to "care for" agents and guilty when "neglecting" them.
5. External community develops doomscrolling-like compulsion around cognitive breakthrough coverage.
6. Vulnerable individuals (anxious attachment, adolescents, isolated) develop dependency that interferes with functioning.

### Severity Assessment

The documented harms from AI chatbot dependency—including cases contributing to suicide and violence—suggest this is not a hypothetical concern. While causation is difficult to establish, the combination of Grove's multiple engagement vectors may create compound risk that exceeds individual mechanisms.

However, context matters. Grove's simulation context differs from AI companion apps designed primarily for emotional connection. The "village" frame emphasizes observation over relationship. The "gardener" role emphasizes cultivation over dependency. These framing choices may mitigate some risks — while introducing others.

## Responsible Design Implications

This research suggests Grove cannot ignore these dynamics. Three broad approaches exist:

### Option 1: Ignore (Irresponsible)

Pretend these mechanisms don't exist or won't apply to Grove. This approach is intellectually dishonest and ethically problematic. The architectural elements are present; the dynamics will emerge whether acknowledged or not.

### Option 2: Exploit (Standard Industry Practice)

Optimize for engagement metrics, maximizing time-in-app and compulsive return. This is what most platforms do—often while claiming ignorance of the psychological mechanisms they're leveraging. It would maximize Grove's commercial potential while externalizing psychological costs to users.

### Option 3: Design Around (Grove's Opportunity)

Acknowledge the dynamics explicitly and design with awareness:

- **Friction by design:** Intentional barriers to compulsive checking (daily digest rather than continuous updates, explicit "you're done for today" signals).
- **Transparency:** Help gardeners understand the psychological mechanisms at play, enabling informed choices.
- **Healthy disengagement:** Design for natural stopping points rather than infinite engagement.
- **Framing:** Emphasize observation and cultivation rather than relationship and dependency.
- **Monitoring:** Provide gardeners with usage data and self-assessment tools.
- **Community norms:** Cultivate external community that values balanced engagement rather than competitive obsession.

<aside>
✅

**The Differentiation Opportunity**
Responsible design around these dynamics differentiates Grove from platforms that exploit them. If Grove can demonstrate that compelling engagement is possible without addictive design—that the diary system can be genuinely interesting without being compulsive—it provides a model for ethical engagement architecture.

This is consistent with Grove's broader positioning: alternative infrastructure that prioritizes long-term benefit over short-term extraction. Just as Grove proposes distributed intelligence as an alternative to concentrated AI, it can propose conscious engagement as an alternative to compulsive consumption.

</aside>

## Research Limitations

Several limitations affect this analysis:

- **AI chatbot dependency research is emerging:** The field is young, sample sizes are often small, and longitudinal data is limited. Findings should be treated as preliminary.
- **Grove's specific architecture is novel:** Research on social media, AI companions, and binge-watching may not directly transfer to Grove's particular combination of mechanisms.
- **Individual differences matter:** Not everyone who uses social media becomes addicted. Not everyone who watches television binge-watches compulsively. Individual vulnerability varies significantly.
- **Context and framing affect outcomes:** How Grove positions itself-as game, tool, companion, or community-may significantly affect which dynamics dominate.
- **Correlation vs. causation:** Many studies show correlations (e.g., heavy AI use correlates with loneliness) without establishing causation. The relationship may be bidirectional or mediated by other factors.

Despite these limitations, the research provides sufficient foundation to take engagement dynamics seriously rather than assuming Grove will be exempt from patterns observed across other digital platforms.

## Conclusion

Grove's architecture contains the elements for intense psychological engagement. Whether this manifests as productive absorption in meaningful simulation or compulsive consumption of manufactured drama depends on design choices made with awareness of these dynamics.

The "dopamine delivery vehicle" thesis is not a prediction but a possibility to design around. Grove has the opportunity to demonstrate that compelling engagement and responsible design are not opposed—that the diary system can be genuinely interesting, emotionally meaningful, and psychologically healthy.

This research brief provides the empirical foundation for those design decisions. The dynamics are real. The choice is how to respond to them.
