# The Ratchet: Quantitative Analysis

# Supporting Evidence for Grove's Infrastructure Thesis

---

## The Core Claim

Grove's architecture is designed to capture AI capability improvements as they propagate from frontier to local models. This isn't speculation—the propagation pattern is empirically documented with six years of data.

## Source Data

**METR Research (March 2025)**: "Measuring AI Ability to Complete Long Tasks"

- Task completion capability doubles every **7 months**
- Trend held for **6 years** with high statistical confidence
- Current frontier (Claude 3.7 Sonnet): ~1 hour tasks at 50% reliability

**Google Research (December 2025)**: Titans + MIRAS architectures

- Test-time memorization enables 2M+ token context windows
- Demonstrates frontier continues advancing (new capabilities to inherit)

## Model 1: Capability Propagation Timeline

**Key assumption**: Local models lag frontier by ~21 months (3 doubling cycles). This is conservative—GPT-4 (March 2023) capability roughly matches Llama 3.1 8B quantized (late 2024).

| Date | Frontier Capability | Local Capability | Gap |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| Dec 2025 | 1 hour | 8 minutes | 8x |
| Dec 2026 | 3.3 hours | 25 minutes | 8x |
| Nov 2027 | 10.8 hours | 1.3 hours | 8x |
| Nov 2028 | 1.5 days | 4.4 hours | 8x |
| Nov 2029 | 4.8 days | 14.5 hours | 8x |

**The gap ratio stays constant.** The frontier keeps moving, and local keeps inheriting. Grove's hybrid architecture captures this permanently—cloud handles today's frontier, local handles yesterday's.

---

## Model 2: Efficiency Tax Decay

The efficiency tax funds the gap between local capability and task requirements. As local improves, fewer tasks require cloud access.

**Scenario**: Tasks requiring ~4 hours of coherent work (complex diary synthesis, theological debate)

| Date | Local Capability | Cloud Dependency | Implied Tax Rate |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| Dec 2025 | 8 min | 97% | 14.5% |
| Dec 2026 | 25 min | 90% | 13.5% |
| Nov 2027 | 1.3 hrs | 66% | 10.0% |
| Nov 2028 | 4.4 hrs | 0% | ~0% |

**The tax shrinks because the system works.** This isn't margin erosion—it's evidence that local capability is catching up. Early participants “fund” the bridge while the gap is wide.

---

## Model 3: Infrastructure Value Comparison

**Centralized model**: Must continually invest to maintain frontier position. Assuming $50B/year base capex growing 20% annually to keep pace.

**Ratchet model**: Captures capability improvements from external R&D (Google, Anthropic, Meta, etc.) without paying for R&D.

| Timeline | Centralized Cumulative CapEx | Ratchet Value Multiplier |
| --- | --- | --- |
| 12 months | $110B | 2.3x starting value |
| 24 months | $182B | 5.3x starting value |
| 36 months | $268B | 12.1x starting value |
| 48 months | $372B | 27.9x starting value |
| 60 months | $496B | 64.0x starting value |

**The ratchet converts competitors' R&D spending into Grove network value.**

Centralized players must spend hundreds of billions to maintain position. Grove inherits capability improvements automatically as open-weight models propagate.

---

## Model 4: The Compounding Formula

```
Grove Network Value = N(t) × C(t) × I(t)

Where:
  N(t) = Network size (nodes/communities) - grows with adoption
  C(t) = Capability per node - grows automatically via propagation
  I(t) = Accumulated collective intelligence - grows with time

```

**Critical insight**: C(t) grows from **external** R&D investments.

- Google spends billions on Titans/MIRAS → capability eventually reaches local models
- Anthropic spends billions improving Claude → open-weight models close the gap
- Meta releases Llama improvements → Grove nodes upgrade automatically

Grove doesn't need to fund AI research. It needs to exist when research outputs propagate.

## Model 5: Grove Milestone Timeline

When does local capability reach key Grove milestones?

| Capability | Hours Required | Local Achieves |
| --- | --- | --- |
| Compelling diary entries | 0.5 hrs | Feb 2027 |
| Multi-agent coordination | 2.0 hrs | Mar 2028 |
| Sophisticated social dynamics | 4.0 hrs | Oct 2028 |
| Theological emergence | 8.0 hrs | May 2029 |
| Full autonomy (week-long tasks) | 168 hrs | Dec 2031 |

**Implication**: The MVP's hybrid architecture isn't permanent scaffolding—it's a bridge to a future where local handles everything Grove currently envisions.

---

## Key Numbers for Decision-Makers

1. **7 months**: Capability doubling time (METR, 6 years of data)
2. **21 months**: Approximate lag from frontier to consumer hardware
3. **8x**: Persistent gap ratio between frontier and local (the gap shrinks in absolute terms but ratio holds as both advance)
4. **$300B+**: Announced centralized AI infrastructure investments (the bet Grove is countering)
5. **$0**: R&D spend required for Grove to capture capability improvements
6. **Oct 2028**: When local models likely handle sophisticated social dynamics without cloud

---

## Implications for Grove Strategy

**MVP (2025-2026)**: Hybrid architecture is essential. Local can't handle complex emergence yet. Cloud fills the gap. Efficiency tax is justified and appropriate.

**Phase 2 (2027-2028)**: Local handles most current use cases. Cloud reserved for new frontier capabilities. Tax declines naturally.

**Steady State (2029+)**: Local may handle everything currently envisioned. Grove's value shifts entirely to network effects, accumulated intelligence, and governance infrastructure. The ratchet has done its job.

**The window matters**: First-mover advantage compounds. Network effects × capability improvements × time creates separation that widens over time.

---

## Sensitivity Analysis

**What if the doubling time slows?**

- 10 months instead of 7 → milestones shift ~18 months later
- Ratchet still works, just slower
- Efficiency tax persists longer (more revenue)

**What if the propagation lag lengthens?**

- 30 months instead of 21 → local capability arrives later
- Cloud dependency persists longer
- Doesn't change the fundamental mechanism

**What if open-weight models stop improving?**

- This would require coordinated cessation of releases by Meta, Mistral, etc.
- Regulatory risk exists but trend shows acceleration, not deceleration
- Grove's architecture still works with whatever local capability exists

---

## Conclusion

The ratchet isn't a metaphor. It's a quantifiable mechanism based on documented capability propagation patterns.

Grove is infrastructure designed to capture a trend that has held for six years and shows no signs of slowing. The question isn't whether capability will propagate—it's who builds infrastructure positioned to capture the propagation.
