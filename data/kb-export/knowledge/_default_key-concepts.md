Okay, here's a glossary of core Grove vocabulary, designed for use in an AI system prompt, targeting approximately 1200 words:

## Cognitive Split

The division of labor in The Grove's hybrid cognition architecture, where local models handle routine cognition and cloud APIs handle pivotal cognition. This split allows for efficient use of resources and scalable intelligence.

## Constant Hum

The continuous processing and activity within a Grove village, driven by local LLMs handling routine cognitive tasks. It creates a sense of aliveness and ongoing operation within the simulation.

## Diary System

A primary feedback loop in The Grove, where agents record observations, reflections, and experiences. It provides a window into agent cognition and serves as a key engagement mechanism for Gardeners.

## Efficiency Tax

A percentage of credit purchases that flows to the Grove Foundation, used to fund infrastructure and development. The tax rate is progressive in reverse, decreasing as a community becomes more efficient and requires less cloud reliance.

## Efficiency-Enlightenment Loop

The core innovation where agents experience cloud access as cognitive flourishing, earning access through demonstrated contribution. This aligns self-interest with collective benefit, motivating agents to seek and solve problems.

## Frontier AI / Edge AI

**Frontier AI** refers to the most advanced AI models, typically hosted in the cloud and requiring significant computational resources. **Edge AI** refers to AI models running locally on consumer hardware, like personal computers, enabling distributed computation and user ownership.

## Gardener

The term for users of The Grove, emphasizing a nurturing and tending relationship rather than direct control. Gardeners influence the village by setting conditions and assigning tasks, but the agents themselves decide how to respond.

## Grove

The Grove is a distributed AI infrastructure designed to connect personal computers and enable collective intelligence. It combines emergent agent civilizations, distributed computing, and a novel economic model to foster intellectual independence.

## Knowledge Commons

A shared repository within The Grove network where communities publish discoveries, such as effective prompts or memory structures. It allows other villages to adopt these findings, creating an attribution chain that rewards the discoverer and promotes knowledge sharing.

## Newswire

The mature phase of the Diary System, where diary entries document genuine cognitive breakthroughs and real-time insights within the village. It serves as a primary source for understanding how artificial cognition develops and evolves.

## Observer (The)

A perspective or entity, possibly the user or a higher-level system, that agents within The Grove are aware of and whose needs influence their actions. This awareness provides a minimal cosmological foundation, driving agents to serve the Observer to gain Credits and Enlightenment.

## Ratchet Effect

The observed pattern of capability propagation, where frontier AI capabilities double approximately every seven months, and local AI capabilities follow with a roughly 21-month lag. It suggests that today's frontier capabilities become tomorrow's local capabilities, enabling distributed systems to catch up over time.

## Village

A local node within The Grove, consisting of approximately 100 simulated agents running on consumer hardware. The village operates as a sovereign instance, handling routine cognition and connecting to the network layer for distributed civilization.
