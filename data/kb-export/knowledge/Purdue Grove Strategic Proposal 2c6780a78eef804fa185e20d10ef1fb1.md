## The Strategic Situation

AI is becoming the substrate for knowledge work. Within five years, AI-augmented research, teaching, and scholarship will be standard practice across every discipline. The question isn’t whether this transformation happens. It’s who controls the infrastructure.

Today, that infrastructure is consolidating rapidly. Five companies control frontier AI capability. $300+ billion in announced investment flows toward centralized data centers. API access policies—set in corporate boardrooms—determine who gets what capability, at what price, under what terms.

Universities face a familiar trap. The academic publishing consolidation of the 1990s-2000s created a system where institutions pay billions annually to access research they themselves produced. Elsevier’s 37% profit margins exceed Apple’s, Google’s, and Amazon’s. Academia recognized the problem too late and has spent two decades trying to claw back ground through open access initiatives with limited success.

The AI version of this trap is worse. Publishing gatekeepers controlled access to knowledge. AI gatekeepers will control access to *the tools for creating knowledge*.

**The window for alternative infrastructure is narrow.** Network effects consolidate quickly. Once researchers depend on specific platforms, switching costs compound. The time to build alternatives is before dependency locks in—not after.

## Why Purdue

Purdue is distinctively positioned to lead this effort. Five factors align:

**1. Leadership that understands architecture**

President Mung Chiang built his academic career on network theory, distributed systems, and information architecture. He understands—at a technical level—why architectural choices create path dependencies. The argument that “distributed beats centralized for resilience and autonomy” doesn’t require translation for this audience. It’s native vocabulary.

**2. Land-grant mission alignment**

Purdue’s founding charter commits it to accessible education serving public benefit. Distributed AI infrastructure that enables participation without gatekeepers *is* the land-grant mission applied to the AI era. This isn’t mission drift—it’s mission continuity.

**3. Engineering credibility without coastal baggage**

A distributed AI initiative led by Stanford or MIT faces immediate skepticism: “More Silicon Valley self-dealing dressed up as public benefit.” Purdue carries different associations. Midwest pragmatism. Engineering substance over marketing. Public institution serving public interest. The messenger matters for this message.

**4. Existing research infrastructure**

Purdue’s computing resources, AI research programs, and engineering talent provide the foundation for serious technical contribution—not just institutional branding. A Purdue-anchored initiative can actually build, not just convene.

**5. Network position for coalition building**

Purdue’s relationships span the Big Ten, the land-grant network, and industry partnerships across sectors. An initiative that starts at Purdue can credibly expand to peer institutions in ways a coastal launch cannot.

## The Coalition Play

Purdue leads. Others join. The coalition structure:

**Tier 1: Anchor Institution**
Purdue provides initial institutional commitment, technical leadership, and coordination infrastructure. The Grove Foundation (nonprofit) partners with Purdue on research, development, and governance design.

**Tier 2: Land-Grant Network**
The 112 land-grant universities share mission DNA. Position distributed AI infrastructure as the logical extension of land-grant principles: public benefit, accessibility, knowledge diffusion. Target 10-15 early adopters from this network—institutions with strong engineering programs and leadership receptive to infrastructure plays.

**Tier 3: Research Universities Broadly**
Expand beyond land-grants to research universities concerned about AI dependency. Frame participation as strategic hedge: if centralized AI proves benign, universities lose nothing; if it proves problematic, participants have alternatives.

**Tier 4: International Partners**
Universities outside the US face even sharper dependency concerns. European institutions under GDPR constraints, institutions in countries with tense US relations, universities in smaller nations with no domestic AI industry—all have structural reasons to prefer distributed infrastructure not controlled by American corporations.

**The network effect logic:** Each participating institution runs Grove nodes on university hardware. Each contributes to and benefits from the knowledge commons. The network becomes more valuable as it grows—and more resilient as it distributes across jurisdictions, governance structures, and political contexts.

## The Downside Scenario: Play the Tape Forward

Strategic planning requires considering uncomfortable futures. Consider:

**2025-2026:** Political consolidation accelerates. Federal agencies face loyalty tests. “Problematic” research areas encounter funding pressure. Universities with controversial programs face donor and legislative backlash.

**2027-2028:** AI capability becomes essential for competitive research. Institutions depend on APIs from providers who depend on federal contracts, regulatory approval, and political goodwill. Self-censorship becomes rational: why risk access by pursuing research that might attract negative attention?

**2029-2030:** The tools for knowledge creation route through chokepoints sensitive to political pressure. An administration hostile to climate science, public health research, or social science findings doesn’t need to ban research. It needs only to make capability access contingent on acceptable conclusions. The chill effect handles the rest.

**This is not speculation.** It’s the playbook authoritarian-adjacent movements have executed against institutions worldwide. Hungarian universities. Turkish academics. Brazilian research funding. The pattern: capture resource allocation, let institutional self-preservation do the censorship work.

**What changes with distributed infrastructure:**

Universities running AI capability on their own hardware, contributing to a knowledge commons governed by academic values, cannot be cut off by API policy changes. Research that loses favor in Washington continues at institutions willing to host it. The network provides refuge for inquiry that centralized infrastructure could choke.

Is this the most likely future? Perhaps not. But the asymmetry matters: building distributed infrastructure costs relatively little and provides research value regardless of political trajectory. *Not* building it leaves universities exposed to a scenario where the cost is intellectual capitulation.

**The hedge logic:** Distributed AI infrastructure is valuable if the future is benign (research platform, cost savings, institutional capability). It’s essential if the future is adversarial (intellectual independence, academic freedom, refuge for inconvenient inquiry). The expected value of building it exceeds the expected value of hoping centralized providers remain neutral and accessible.

## The Strategic Frame

Purdue has an opportunity to lead infrastructure development that matters—not just for competitive positioning, but for the integrity of the academic enterprise.

The publishing trap took decades to recognize and may take decades more to escape. The AI trap is forming now, faster, with higher stakes. The institutions that build alternatives early will shape how this infrastructure develops. The institutions that wait will adapt to infrastructure shaped by others.

Land-grant universities were founded to democratize knowledge—to ensure education and research served public benefit, not just elite interests. Distributed AI infrastructure is the land-grant mission for the age of artificial intelligence.

Purdue can lead this. The question is whether it will.
