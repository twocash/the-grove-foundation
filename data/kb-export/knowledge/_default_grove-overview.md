# The Grove: TL;DR

**1. The Centralized AI Bet:**
Big Tech companies are investing $300B+ in centralized AI infrastructure, betting that AI scales through concentration and that the gap between frontier and local models is insurmountable. This approach risks concentrating AI power and benefits in the hands of a few large entities.

**2. The Ratchet Thesis:**
The Grove's core thesis is "The Ratchet," which posits that frontier AI capabilities double every 7 months, while local capabilities follow the same curve with a 21-month lag, maintaining a roughly 8x performance gap; this means today's cloud-only breakthroughs become tomorrow's local commodity. The Grove aims to exploit this trend, bootstrapping itself with cloud resources that diminish as local capabilities advance.

**3. Hybrid Cognition:**
Grove leverages a hybrid cognition architecture, offloading routine tasks (perception, memory) to local LLMs while routing pivotal reasoning (complex synthesis, novel insights) to the cloud; this optimizes resource utilization and reduces reliance on centralized infrastructure. This cognitive split allows agents to remember cloud-based insights, improving local performance over time.

**4. Ownership vs. Rental:**
Local ownership of AI infrastructure ensures users control their data, models, and computational resources, fostering intellectual independence and preventing vendor lock-in; this contrasts with cloud-based AI services, where users rent resources and cede control to centralized providers. By owning the infrastructure, contributors benefit directly from AI's advancements.

**5. Grove's Unique Position:**
The Grove uniquely integrates emergent agent civilizations, distributed computing, and a novel economic model that converts capability propagation into network equity; it is a distributed AI infrastructure for the post-labor economy, designed for community governance and Foundation obsolescence. This approach prioritizes distribution over concentration, and ensures that the AI infrastructure is owned by its contributors.
