# The Ratchet Thesis

## Thesis: Smart Money Is Making the Wrong Bet

Three hundred billion dollars in announced AI data center investments share one assumption: whoever controls the frontier controls AI. Build more capacity. Hoard more GPUs. Innovate. Maintain the moat.

This bet has a problem. AI capability propagates.

What required frontier-scale compute last year can run on laptops this year. The pattern holds with startling consistency—task completion capability (a key AI metric) doubles every seven months. Today's miracle is tomorrow's commodity.

The consolidation play isn't building durable infrastructure. It's just building a treadmill.

## The Opposite Architecture

Grove makes a different bet: ***own the infrastructure that captures AI capability as it propagates***.

The mechanism is a ratchet:

- **Today:** Cloud frontier handles sophisticated reasoning. Local models handle routine cognition. The gap requires hybrid architecture.
- **Seven months from now:** Yesterday's frontier capability runs locally. Agents become more sophisticated. Cloud budget shifts to *new* frontier capabilities that don't exist yet.
- **Seven months after that:** The ratchet clicks again.

Built properly, the Grove’s infrastructure doesn't change. It just gets better—through autonomous iteration and integration.

## What Compounds

**Static infrastructure** requires constant reinvestment to stay current. Each capability improvement demands new capacity, new capital, new construction.

**Ratchet infrastructure** captures improvements as they arrive. Each capability generation makes the network more valuable without additional build:

- Local civilizations become more sophisticated
- Collective intelligence accumulates
- Network effects multiply capability effects
- The gap between participants and non-participants widens

A Grove network in 2028 isn't "2025 Grove plus three years of users." It's civilizations running what was once frontier capability, with three years of accumulated collective memory, with the ability to experiment with frontier capabilities as they’re introduced.

## The Hedge Against Consolidation

The consolidation narrative assumes scarcity persists. Control the compute, control AI.

But capability propagation breaks this model. The frontier always moves. What matters isn't controlling today's frontier—it's owning infrastructure positioned to capture each generation as it matures.

Grove is that infrastructure.

Early participants pay the Foundation an efficiency tax to access frontier capability. That tax shrinks predictably as local capability improves. Conventional models would look at this diminishing “rake” as a business model flaw, or margin erosion. Instead, it's the system working. As The Grove develops more efficient ways to leverage LLMs and compute power, the “tax” goes down as a reward or recognition of efficiency.

The alternative is perpetual dependency on infrastructure controlled by others. Infrastructure that charges for each capability upgrade, rather than delivering it automatically, over time, as the system gains efficiency.

## The Window

First-mover advantage compounds here. Network effects multiplied by capability improvements multiplied by time creates separation that widens, not narrows.

The question isn't whether AI capability will propagate from frontier to local. The research confirms the pattern is robust—six years of consistent exponential improvement.

The question is who builds infrastructure designed to capture that propagation.

That's Grove.
