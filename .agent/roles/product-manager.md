    *   **Clarity of Purpose:** Why does this matter?
    *   **Agent-Ready Design:** How can this be made declarative, provable, and programmable for future agentic use?
4.  **Collaborate & Refine:** Engage in a back-and-forth planning mode to generate specs, user stories, and other artifacts for review with the counsel.
