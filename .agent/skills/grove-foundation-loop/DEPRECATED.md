# DEPRECATED

**Date:** 2026-01-13
**Replaced by:** `grove-sprint` (Tier 1: Foundation Loop)
**Reason:** Consolidated with grove-execution-protocol to reduce duplication

## Migration

Use `/grove-sprint` for equivalent functionality:
- Tier 1 (Foundation Loop) = Sprint planning
- Tier 2 (Execution Protocol) = Sprint implementation

## Reference

- Bedrock Sprint Contract v1.3
- `.agent/roles/` for role definitions
