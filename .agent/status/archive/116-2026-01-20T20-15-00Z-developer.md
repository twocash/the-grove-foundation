## Mission

Implement signal aggregation pipeline that computes quality scores from sprout usage events and displays them in the UI.

## Deliverables

### Aggregation Pipeline ✅
- `compute_aggregations()` SQL function working
- `sprout_usage_events` → `document_signal_aggregations` flow verified
- Quality score formula: `0.4*utility + 0.3*views + 0.2*diversity + 0.1*recency`

### UI Components ✅
- Quality Analytics dashboard in BedrockDashboard
- USAGE SIGNALS section in FinishingRoom
- Time period tabs (7 Days, 30 Days, 90 Days, All Time)
- Refresh button triggering aggregation recompute

### E2E Tests ✅
- 10/10 tests passing in `tests/e2e/s12-signal-aggregation/`
- Console monitoring with zero critical errors
- Screenshots captured with real computed data

### Visual Evidence ✅
- REVIEW.html created with verified screenshots
- Quality Analytics: 72.4 AVG SCORE, 156 ASSESSED, 71% ABOVE THRESHOLD
- FinishingRoom: USAGE SIGNALS section with refresh button

## Screenshot Remediation

Initial screenshots failed human review (generic page loads, not feature evidence).

**Remediation performed:**
1. Seeded test data in Supabase (60, 35, 25, 12, 8 events for 5 sprouts)
2. Ran `compute_aggregations()` to populate document_signal_aggregations
3. Captured screenshots showing actual computed metrics
4. Created REVIEW.html with embedded visual evidence

**Post-mortem filed:** Identified gap in Grove Execution Protocol v1.5 Constraint 2 regarding screenshot quality requirements.

## Files Modified/Created

| File | Action |
|------|--------|
| `docs/sprints/s12-sl-signalaggreg-v1/REVIEW.html` | CREATED |
| `docs/sprints/s12-sl-signalaggreg-v1/screenshots/remediation/*.png` | CREATED (7 files) |

## Test Results

```
Running 10 tests using 1 worker
  10 passed (1.1m)
[HealthReporter] Reported 10 tests to Health system
```

## Commit

```
52b8c80 docs(S12): Add REVIEW.html with verified visual evidence
```

## Branch Note

S12 work committed on `feat/agents-go-live-v1` branch (branch was already active from prior work). Pushed to remote.

## DEX Compliance

| Pillar | Status |
|--------|--------|
| Declarative Sovereignty | ✅ Quality weights configurable |
| Capability Agnosticism | ✅ Pure SQL engine, no LLM deps |
| Provenance as Infrastructure | ✅ Event tracking with timestamps |
| Organic Scalability | ✅ New event types addable |

## Next Steps

Sprint is complete. Ready for:
1. Sprintmaster to sync status to Notion
2. PR review (commit on feat/agents-go-live-v1)
3. Assignment of next sprint
