## Mission

Executing sprint S19-BD-JsonRenderFactory - creating a unified json-render component factory with namespaced catalogs, shared base primitives, and a single renderer. Migrating all 8 existing catalogs to the factory pattern.

## Current Phase

Phase 0: Contract Setup
- SPEC.md exists
- EXECUTION_PROMPT.md exists
- DEVLOG.md exists
- Feature branch pending

## Test Routes

- `/bedrock/*` - WHERE JSON-RENDER COMPONENTS LIVE
- NOT `/` or `/terminal` (FROZEN ZONE)

## Expected Deliverables

- `src/core/json-render/` - Core infrastructure (types, factory, base catalog)
- `src/bedrock/json-render/` - Unified renderer + migrated catalogs
- 8 catalog migrations with visual verification
- Component Catalog Browser in System Settings
- E2E tests with console monitoring

## Phases

| Phase | Target | Status |
|-------|--------|--------|
| 0 | Contract Setup | ✅ Complete |
| 1 | Core Infrastructure | Pending |
| 2 | Unified Renderer | Pending |
| 3 | SignalsCatalog Migration | Pending |
| 4 | QualityAnalyticsCatalog Migration | Pending |
| 5 | ModelAnalyticsCatalog Migration | Pending |
| 6 | AttributionCatalog Migration | Pending |
| 7 | ScoreAttributionCatalog Migration | Pending |
| 8 | OverrideHistoryCatalog Migration | Pending |
| 9 | QualityCatalog Migration | Pending |
| 10 | ResearchCatalog Migration | Pending |
| 11 | System Settings UI | Pending |
| 12 | Cleanup & Documentation | Pending |
| 13 | E2E Verification | Pending |

## DEX Compliance

| Pillar | Status |
|--------|--------|
| Declarative Sovereignty | All schemas in Zod |
| Capability Agnosticism | No model-specific code |
| Provenance as Infrastructure | Namespace = origin tracking |
| Organic Scalability | Factory enables extension |

## Namespacing Convention

```
base:Stack              ← From base catalog
signals:QualityGauge    ← From signals catalog
research:SourceList     ← From research catalog
```
