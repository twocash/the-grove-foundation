phase: Phase 6 - E2E Testing Complete

## Mission

Executed sprint prompt-architect-v1 - implementing the Prompt Architect Infrastructure that transforms `sprout:` commands in `/explore` into executed research with full provenance tracking.

## Deliverables

### E2E Test Suite ✅
- `tests/e2e/prompt-architect.spec.ts` - 7 tests covering all user stories
- Console monitoring with zero critical errors
- Full lifecycle coverage (not just happy path)

### Test Results ✅
```
Running 7 tests using 1 worker
  7 passed (1.7m)

Test Coverage:
- US-B001: Plant Research Sprout - Full E2E Flow (40.4s) PASS
- US-B003: Reject Off-Topic Research Query (13.5s) PASS
- US-B006: Config Loads from Supabase (10.8s) PASS
- US-B009: Monitor Research Progress in Nursery (7.1s) PASS
- US-B008: Verify Provenance Tracking Setup (6.8s) PASS
- Nursery Console Stability (7.6s) PASS
- Explore Page Stability (8.5s) PASS
```

### Visual Evidence ✅
- **22 screenshots** captured to `docs/sprints/prompt-architect-v1/screenshots/e2e/`
- REVIEW.html updated with all embedded evidence
- Screenshot naming follows convention: `us-{id}-{step}-{description}.png`

### Infrastructure Verification ✅
- Supabase tables exist: `prompt_architect_configs`, `research_sprouts`
- Config `config-grove-foundation-v1` active with Grove hypotheses
- Phases 1-5 verified as implemented in prior sprout-research-v1 sprint

## Test Routes Verified

| Route | Purpose | Status |
|-------|---------|--------|
| `/explore` | Sprout command processing | ✅ Tested |
| `/bedrock/nursery` | Sprout display and monitoring | ✅ Tested |
| `/` | FROZEN ZONE | ❌ NOT touched |
| `/terminal` | FROZEN ZONE | ❌ NOT touched |

## Console Audit

**Zero critical console errors detected across all 7 tests.**

Monitored patterns:
- `Cannot read properties` - None
- `Unexpected Application Error` - None
- `TypeError` / `ReferenceError` - None
- State machine errors - None

## Files Created/Modified

| File | Action |
|------|--------|
| `tests/e2e/prompt-architect.spec.ts` | CREATED |
| `docs/sprints/prompt-architect-v1/screenshots/e2e/*.png` | CREATED (22 files) |
| `docs/sprints/prompt-architect-v1/REVIEW.html` | UPDATED |

## DEX Compliance

| Pillar | Status |
|--------|--------|
| Declarative Sovereignty | ✅ Config-driven hypothesis alignment |
| Capability Agnosticism | ✅ Pipeline works with any LLM backend |
| Provenance as Infrastructure | ✅ Sprouts track origin, config, timestamps |
| Organic Scalability | ✅ New hypotheses addable via config |

## Next Steps

Sprint is complete. Ready for:
1. Sprintmaster to sync status to Notion
2. PR review and merge
3. Assignment of next sprint
