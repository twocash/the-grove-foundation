## Mission

Executing sprint prompt-architect-v1 - implementing the Prompt Architect Infrastructure that transforms `sprout:` commands in `/explore` into executed research with full provenance tracking.

## Current Phase

Phase 0: Pre-work Verification
- Verify Supabase tables exist
- Verify test config exists
- Run build to confirm clean baseline

## Test Routes

- `/explore` - WHERE sprout: COMMAND WORKS
- `/bedrock/nursery` - WHERE SPROUTS SURFACE
- NOT `/` or `/terminal` (FROZEN ZONE)

## Expected Deliverables

- 17+ screenshots
- E2E test: tests/e2e/prompt-architect.spec.ts
- Zero critical console errors
- REVIEW.html with all evidence
