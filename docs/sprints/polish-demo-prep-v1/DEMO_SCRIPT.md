# Demo Script: Research Pipeline v1.0

> A ~3 minute walkthrough demonstrating the complete research lifecycle

## Duration: ~3 minutes

---

## Scene 1: Introduction (30s)

**Narration:**
"Welcome to the Grove Research Pipeline demo. I'll show you how a single question transforms into a fully-cited research document — from spark to sprout to scholarship."

**Screen:**
- Show the Grove Foundation landing page
- Navigate to the Explore section

---

## Scene 2: Spark Command (30s)

**Narration:**
"Everything starts with a spark — a research question you want to explore. I'll use the sprout command to plant a new research investigation."

**Actions:**
1. Show terminal input with `sprout:` prefix
2. Enter query: "What are the economic implications of AI on local hardware ownership?"
3. Submit the query

**Key Points:**
- The `sprout:` prefix triggers research mode
- The Prompt Architect analyzes your query
- A research plan is inferred automatically

---

## Scene 3: Confirmation Review (30s)

**Narration:**
"Before executing, the system shows you the research plan. You can adjust the title, add instructions, or customize the approach."

**Screen:**
- Show the Garden Inspector in confirmation mode
- Highlight the title field
- Highlight the instructions/prompt field

**Key Points:**
- Users maintain control over research direction
- Instructions guide the AI's research focus
- Title helps organize multiple sprouts

---

## Scene 4: Research Phase (60s)

**Narration:**
"Watch the research phase in action. The system breaks down your question into research branches, searches for relevant sources, and collects evidence in real-time."

**Actions:**
1. Click "Start Research" to begin
2. Point out the phase progression bar: Research → Writing → Complete
3. Show sources appearing as they're discovered
4. Call out the current branch being processed

**Key Points:**
- Real-time progress visibility
- Sources displayed with domain badges
- Branch-by-branch execution
- Typically 3-4 research branches per query

---

## Scene 5: Writing Phase (30s)

**Narration:**
"Once evidence is gathered, the Writer Agent synthesizes everything into a coherent document. It maintains the Grove voice and includes inline citations."

**Screen:**
- Phase indicator transitions to "Writing"
- Show the progress updating
- Progress bar fills from Research to Writing

**Key Points:**
- Evidence is preserved even if writing fails
- Citations are automatically numbered
- Document follows Grove style guidelines

---

## Scene 6: Results Display (30s)

**Narration:**
"And here's our completed research document. Notice the position statement at the top, followed by detailed analysis with inline citations."

**Screen:**
- Show ResearchResultsView with completed document
- Scroll to show:
  - Position card with confidence score
  - Analysis section with [1], [2] citations
  - Expandable citations section
- Click "Copy" button

**Key Points:**
- Clear position statement
- Inline citation references
- Source verification links
- Copy to clipboard for external use

---

## Scene 7: Knowledge Base Integration (15s)

**Narration:**
"Want to save this research? Click 'Add to KB' to promote it to the Grove knowledge corpus with full provenance tracking."

**Actions:**
1. Click "Add to Knowledge Base" button
2. Show success toast notification
3. Mention "View in Corpus" action

**Key Points:**
- Full provenance chain preserved
- Research becomes reusable in future sessions
- Feeds the Grove knowledge commons

---

## Scene 8: Wrap-up (15s)

**Narration:**
"That's the v1.0 research pipeline — from question to cited document in under 90 seconds. Plant your spark, watch it grow, harvest the knowledge."

**Screen:**
- Return to the Garden Inspector list view
- Show the completed sprout in the list

## Demo Tips

### Before Recording
- [ ] Clear browser cache/localStorage for fresh state
- [ ] Use a simple, compelling research question
- [ ] Ensure stable internet connection
- [ ] Close unnecessary tabs/applications
- [ ] Set display resolution to 1920x1080

### During Recording
- [ ] Speak slowly and clearly
- [ ] Pause briefly at key moments
- [ ] Point cursor at important UI elements
- [ ] Don't rush through phases

### Good Demo Queries
- "What are the economic implications of AI on local hardware ownership?"
- "How does distributed computing compare to cloud-centric architectures?"
- "What is the Ratchet Effect in AI infrastructure?"

### Fallback Plan
If research takes too long (>60s):
- Explain this is normal for complex queries
- Mention the 90-second timeout protection
- Note that results are still valid

---

## Technical Notes

- **Typical execution time:** 30-60 seconds
- **Timeout threshold:** 90 seconds
- **Expected sources:** 3-8 per query
- **Average document length:** 800-1500 words
